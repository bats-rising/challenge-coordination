**Welcome to the Capture the Drone Control Repository!** 🎯

This is your central hub for help, questions, and collaboration during the challenge. Please read this guide carefully before opening any issues.

## 🎯 When to Open Which Issue Type

### 🆘 Help Request
**Use when:** You're stuck on a technical problem with your code or implementation

**Examples:**
- "My Kalman filter diverges after 10 iterations"
- "MCAP parsing throws a deserialization error"
- "How do I implement data association for multiple targets?"

**Required info:**
- Your team name
- Link to your team repository
- What you've already tried
- Specific error messages or code snippets

**Response time:** Other teams typically respond within 30 minutes  
**Collaboration points:** Teams helping you earn 15-35 points

---

### ❓ Question
**Use when:** You need clarification about challenge rules, scope, or logistics (NOT technical code help)

**Examples:**
- "What's the exact deadline for Day 2 deliverables?"
- "Are we allowed to use external tracking libraries?"
- "How is the final evaluation score calculated?"

**Required info:**
- Clear question
- Why you're asking (context)
- What you've already checked

**Response time:** Coordinators respond at 12:00 and 18:00 daily  
**Collaboration points:** No points (coordinators answer)

---

### 🐞 Infrastructure Bug Report
**Use when:** Something is broken with the challenge infrastructure (NOT your own code)

**Examples:**
- "The provided MCAP dataset is corrupted"
- "Evaluation script crashes on valid output"
- "Setup instructions reference non-existent files"

**Required info:**
- Affected component (dataset, script, etc.)
- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details

**Response time:** High priority – coordinators respond within 1 hour  
**Collaboration points:** No points (infrastructure fixes)

## 🏆 How Collaboration Points Work

### Earning Points by Helping

When you **answer a help request**, you earn collaboration points:

| What You Provide | Base Points |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Text guidance, hints, or explanations | **15 pts** |
| Code examples or working snippets | **20 pts** |

### Bonus Points

**Quick Response Bonus (+10 pts)**
- Answer within 30 minutes of issue being opened
- Automatically tracked via timestamps

**Quality Help Bonus (+5 pts)**
- Requesting team adds `quality-help` label when closing
- Reserved for exceptional, teaching-focused help
- Coordinators validate before awarding points

### Maximum Per Help Request
- **Up to 35 points** per help request (20 base + 10 quick + 5 quality)
- Multiple teams can help on the same issue
- Only the team that solves the problem gets the points

---

## ✅ How to Signal High-Quality Help

When **closing a help request** that you opened:

1. **Always comment** with 👍 to confirm the help worked
2. **Close the issue** to mark it as resolved
3. **Add `quality-help` label** if the help was exceptional:
   - Explained concepts clearly (teaching-focused)
   - Included code examples with explanations
   - Asked guiding questions instead of just giving answers
   - Connected to real-world applications
   - Went above and beyond basic troubleshooting

Coordinators review all `quality-help` labels and validate before awarding bonus points.

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't copy-paste complete solutions**
- Provide guidance, not finished code
- Help teams understand, don't do their work

❌ **Don't ask code questions as "Questions"**
- Technical help belongs in Help Requests
- Questions are for rules/scope/logistics only

❌ **Don't report your own code bugs as Infrastructure Bugs**
- Infrastructure bugs are for challenge-provided materials only
- Your code bugs should be Help Requests

❌ **Don't abuse the `quality-help` label**
- Only use for truly exceptional help
- Coordinators will remove invalid quality-help labels

❌ **Don't spam or create duplicate issues**
- Search existing issues first
- One issue per problem

---

## 📋 Before Opening Any Issue

**Checklist:**
- [ ] I've read this pinned issue completely
- [ ] I've searched existing issues for duplicates
- [ ] I've chosen the correct issue template
- [ ] I have all required information ready
- [ ] I've checked the Challenge Overview in my team repository

## 🆘 I'm Blocked for >2 Hours!

If your team is stuck for **more than 2 hours** on a critical blocker:

1. **Open a Help Request** with `[URGENT]` in the title
2. **Comment on your issue** mentioning you've been blocked for 2+ hours
3. **Ping coordinators** in your team communication channel

Coordinators will:
- Escalate to specialist agents (Radar Expert, ROS2 Specialist, etc.)
- Provide targeted guidance
- Ensure you can make progress

---

## 📞 Still Have Questions?

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Read the **README.md** in this repository
2. Check the **Challenge Overview** in your team's repository
3. Open a **Question** issue (not a Help Request)

- Show what you've already tried
- Include error messages and code context
- Close issues promptly when resolved

**For Helping Others:**
- Respond quickly for bonus points
